**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a backend developer with experience in Node.js, MongoDB, and NestJS. This challenge will test a candidate's ability to work with these technologies and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.**

**Title:** User Management System

**Description:** You are tasked with building a simple User Management System using Node.js, MongoDB, and NestJS. This system should allow users to register, login, view their profile, and update their profile information.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a user model that includes at least the following fields:

    - Username
    - Email
    - Password (hashed)
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Date of birth
    - Profile picture (stored as a URL)

2.  Implement the following API endpoints using NestJS:

    - Register a new user
    - Login with a registered user
    - View the user's own profile
    - Update the user's profile information

3.  Implement JWT authentication for user registration and login. Return a JWT token upon successful login.
4.  Implement validation and error handling for the API endpoints. Ensure that the API returns appropriate error messages for validation failures and other errors.
5.  Use MongoDB as the database to store user data. You can use an ODM library like Mongoose to work with MongoDB.
6.  Secure the application against common security vulnerabilities.
7.  Write unit tests for your controllers and services to ensure the functionality of your endpoints.
8.  Use proper project structure and organization following NestJS best practices.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement user roles (admin, regular user) and restrict certain actions to admin users.
- Implement password reset and email verification features.
- Implement pagination and sorting for user lists.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform of your choice.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your NestJS project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Make sure to include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Security practices.
5.  Use of best practices in NestJS and MongoDB.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a simple user management system using Node.js, MongoDB, and NestJS, with a focus on code quality, security, and best practices.
