**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a backend developer with experience in Node.js, MongoDB, and NestJS. This challenge will test the candidate's ability to work with these technologies and showcase their problem-solving skills.**

**Title:** Task Management System

**Description:** You are tasked with building a Task Management System using Node.js, MongoDB, and NestJS. This system should allow users to create tasks, assign tasks to users, and manage tasks.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a user model with at least the following fields:

    - Username
    - Email
    - Password (hashed)

2.  Create a task model with the following fields:

    - Title
    - Description
    - Due date
    - Status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed)
    - Assignee (reference to a user)

3.  Implement the following API endpoints using NestJS:

    - Register a new user
    - Login with a registered user
    - Create a new task
    - View all tasks
    - View tasks assigned to a specific user
    - Update the task status
    - Delete a task

4.  Implement JWT authentication for user registration and login. Return a JWT token upon successful login.
5.  Implement validation and error handling for the API endpoints. Ensure that the API returns appropriate error messages for validation failures and other errors.
6.  Use MongoDB as the database to store user and task data. You can use an ODM library like Mongoose to work with MongoDB.
7.  Secure the application against common security vulnerabilities.
8.  Write unit tests for your controllers and services to ensure the functionality of your endpoints.
9.  Use proper project structure and organization following NestJS best practices.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement pagination and sorting for task lists.
- Allow users to update task details, not just the status.
- Implement comments for tasks.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform of your choice.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your NestJS project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Make sure to include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Security practices.
5.  Use of best practices in NestJS and MongoDB.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a task management system using Node.js, MongoDB, and NestJS, with a focus on code quality, security, and best practices.
