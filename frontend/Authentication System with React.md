**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a front-end developer with experience in React, React DOM, React forms, and authentication. This challenge will test a candidate's ability to work with front-end technologies to build a complete authentication system.**

**Title:** Authentication System with React

**Description:** You are tasked with building an authentication system using React that allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The application should include user registration, login, user profile display, and logout functionality.

**Requirements:**

**User Authentication:**

1.  Create a user registration form with the following fields:

    - Username
    - Email
    - Password

2.  Implement user registration using an API endpoint (you can use a mock server or a backend API library like JSONPlaceholder).
3.  Create a user login form with the following fields:

    - Email
    - Password

4.  Implement user login using an API endpoint.
5.  Implement user logout functionality.

**User Profile:**

6.  After logging in, users should be able to view their user profile, which displays their username and email.

**Routing:**

7.  Use React Router to create routes for the following views:
    - Home (public)
    - Registration (public)
    - Login (public)
    - Profile (private, requires authentication)
    - Logout (private, requires authentication)

**Authentication:**

8.  Implement user authentication using React context, state management, or libraries like Redux. Users should remain authenticated between page reloads.
9.  Ensure that only authenticated users can access the Profile and Logout views. Unauthorized users should be redirected to the Login view.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement form validation for the registration and login forms.
- Add user registration error handling (e.g., email already in use).
- Create a user profile editing feature.
- Implement user authentication using a third-party service like Firebase.
- Enhance the user profile with additional information (e.g., user profile picture).

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your React project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings. If you used a mock server, please include instructions on how to set it up.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Effective use of React for user interface and state management.
5.  Use of best practices in React development.
6.  User authentication implementation and routing.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a user authentication system using React, with a focus on code quality, user experience, and best practices.
