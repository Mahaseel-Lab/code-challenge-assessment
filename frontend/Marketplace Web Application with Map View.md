**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a front-end developer with experience in React, building a marketplace-style application with a map view. This challenge will test a candidate's ability to work with React, integrate with maps, and create an interactive user interface.**

**Title:** Marketplace Web Application with Map View

**Description:** You are tasked with building a marketplace-style web application using React that allows users to view, search, and interact with listings. The application should include a map view to display the location of listings.

**Requirements:**

**Front-End:**

1.  Create a React application with the following features:

    - A homepage displaying a list of listings.
    - A search bar for filtering and searching listings.
    - A map view displaying the locations of listings on a map (you can use libraries like React Leaflet for this).
    - A detailed listing page that shows additional information about a listing when clicked.

2.  The listings should include the following information:

    - Title
    - Description
    - Price
    - Location (latitude and longitude)
    - Contact information

3.  Implement responsive design to ensure the application works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Map View:**

4.  Integrate a map library (e.g., React Leaflet) to display the locations of listings on the map. Users should be able to click on map markers to view the associated listing details.

**Marketplace Functionality:**

5.  Implement a search functionality that allows users to filter listings based on keywords, location, or price range.
6.  Create a detailed view for each listing that displays additional information about the listing.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Allow users to post new listings.
- Implement user authentication and the ability for users to edit or delete their own listings.
- Implement user authentication and the ability to save favorite listings.
- Add features like image uploads for listings, reviews, and ratings.
- Implement routing for individual listing pages.
- Add pagination for the listings.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your React project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Effective use of React and map integration.
5.  User interface design and usability.
6.  Responsive design for various screen sizes.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a marketplace-style web application with map view using React, with a focus on code quality, user experience, and best practices.
