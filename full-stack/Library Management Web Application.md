**Certainly! Here's another code challenge assessment for a full-stack developer with experience in Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. This challenge focuses on building a complete web application for managing a library of books.**

**Title:** Library Management Web Application

**Description:** You are tasked with building a library management web application using Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. This application should allow users to view, search, add, edit, and delete books in a library.

**Requirements:**

**Back-End:**

1.  Create a Node.js and Express server to serve as the back-end.
2.  Define a book model with the following fields:

    - Title
    - Author
    - ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
    - Description
    - Number of copies available
    - User ID (to associate books with specific users)

3.  Implement RESTful API endpoints for the following operations:

    - User registration
    - User login
    - View a list of books in the library
    - View a single book by ISBN
    - Add a new book to the library
    - Update book details
    - Delete a book from the library

4.  Implement JWT-based authentication for user registration and login. Return a JWT token upon successful login.
5.  Use MongoDB as the database to store user data and book information. You can use an ODM library like Mongoose to work with MongoDB.
6.  Secure the application against common security vulnerabilities.
7.  Write unit tests for your API endpoints and services to ensure their functionality.

**Front-End:**

1.  Create a React front-end for the web application.
2.  Implement user registration and login screens.
3.  Implement a library dashboard where users can:

    - View a list of books in the library.
    - Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
    - Add a new book to the library.
    - Update book details.
    - Delete books from the library.

4.  Ensure that the front-end communicates with the back-end to perform these operations.
5.  Implement error handling and user-friendly feedback for situations like authentication failures or API errors.
6.  Make the app responsive and visually appealing.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement user roles (admin, regular user) and restrict certain actions to admin users.
- Add the ability to check out and return books.
- Implement book covers and descriptions for each book.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform of your choice.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your full-stack project, including both the back-end and front-end code. Include a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Make sure to include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization in both the front-end and back-end.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Security practices.
5.  Use of best practices in Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB, with a focus on code quality, security, and best practices.
