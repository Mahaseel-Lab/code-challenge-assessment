**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a full-stack developer with experience in Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. This challenge will evaluate a candidate's ability to work with both the front-end and back-end technologies to create a complete web application.**

**Title:** Task Management Web Application

**Description:** You are tasked with building a task management web application using Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. This application should allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks.

**Requirements:**

**Back-End:**

1.  Create a Node.js and Express server to serve as the back-end.
2.  Define a task model with the following fields:

    - Title
    - Description
    - Due date
    - Status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed)
    - User ID (to associate tasks with specific users)

3.  Implement RESTful API endpoints for the following operations:

    - User registration
    - User login
    - Create a new task
    - View a list of tasks for the logged-in user
    - View a single task by ID
    - Update a task's details
    - Delete a task

4.  Implement JWT-based authentication for user registration and login. Return a JWT token upon successful login.
5.  Use MongoDB as the database to store user data and tasks. You can use an ODM library like Mongoose to work with MongoDB.
6.  Secure the application against common security vulnerabilities.
7.  Write unit tests for your API endpoints and services to ensure their functionality.

**Front-End:**

1.  Create a React front-end for the web application.
2.  Implement user registration and login screens.
3.  Implement a dashboard where users can:

    - View a list of their tasks.
    - Create a new task.
    - Update task details.
    - Delete tasks.

4.  Ensure that the front-end communicates with the back-end to perform these operations.
5.  Implement error handling and user-friendly feedback for situations like authentication failures or API errors.
6.  Make the app responsive and visually appealing.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement user roles (admin, regular user) and restrict certain actions to admin users.
- Allow users to prioritize and categorize tasks.
- Implement real-time updates for task statuses.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform of your choice.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your full-stack project, including both the back-end and front-end code. Include a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Make sure to include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization in both the front-end and back-end.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Security practices.
5.  Use of best practices in Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB, with a focus on code quality, security, and best practices.
