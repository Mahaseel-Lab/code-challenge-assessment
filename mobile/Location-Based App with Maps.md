**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a React Native mobile developer with experience in GPS integration, Firebase, and maps. This challenge will test the candidate's ability to work with these technologies and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.**

**Title:** Location-Based App with Maps

**Description:** You are tasked with building a React Native mobile app that leverages GPS functionality, integrates with Firebase for data storage, and displays user locations on a map. Users can share their real-time location with others and see the locations of their friends on a map.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a React Native app with the following features:

    - User registration and authentication using Firebase Authentication.
    - Real-time location sharing with other users.
    - A map view that displays user locations, including their real-time movement.
    - The ability to view the locations of friends on the map.
    - Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication (e.g., email/password or social login methods).

2.  Integrate GPS functionality to obtain the user's current location and update it in real-time.
3.  Use Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve user locations and user profiles.
4.  Display user locations on a map using a mapping library like React Native Maps.
5.  Implement error handling and user-friendly feedback for situations like authentication failures or location sharing errors.
6.  Make the app responsive and visually appealing.
7.  Implement unit tests for your components, Redux actions, and reducers.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement geofencing and provide notifications when users enter or exit predefined areas.
- Allow users to send location-sharing requests to specific friends.
- Implement real-time location updates using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Deploy the app to a mobile app store or provide instructions on how to build and run it on a physical device.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your React Native project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings, especially Firebase configuration details.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Usability and user experience of the app.
5.  Effective use of GPS integration, Firebase, and maps.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a React Native mobile app that integrates GPS functionality, Firebase for user authentication and data storage, and maps for real-time location tracking, with a focus on code quality, user experience, and best practices.
