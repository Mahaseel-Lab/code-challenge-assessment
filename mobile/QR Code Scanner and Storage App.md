**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a React Native mobile developer with experience in Redux, QR code integration, and local storage. This challenge will test the candidate's ability to work with these technologies and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.**

**Title:** QR Code Scanner and Storage App

**Description:** You are tasked with building a React Native mobile app that allows users to scan QR codes, store the data from those codes locally, and manage their stored QR code data.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a React Native app with the following features:

    - A QR code scanner screen that can access the device's camera and scan QR codes.
    - A screen to display the data (text) from the scanned QR code.
    - A screen to view a list of previously scanned QR codes.
    - Ability to add notes to scanned QR codes for reference.
    - Ability to delete or edit notes for each stored QR code.

2.  Implement Redux for state management to handle the scanned QR code data and notes.
3.  Implement local storage to persist the scanned QR code data and notes on the device.
4.  Ensure proper navigation between the different screens using React Navigation.
5.  Implement error handling and user-friendly feedback for situations where scanning fails or storage is full.
6.  Make the app responsive and visually appealing.
7.  Implement unit tests for your components and Redux actions/reducers.
8.  Provide an option to clear all stored QR codes and their associated notes.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement user authentication and user-specific storage.
- Allow the option to share QR code data via social media or messaging apps.
- Implement QR code generation feature.
- Add filtering and sorting options for stored QR codes.
- Deploy the app to a mobile app store or provide instructions on how to build and run it on a physical device.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your React Native project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Make sure to include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Usability and user experience of the app.
5.  Effective use of Redux and local storage.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a React Native mobile app that integrates QR code scanning, local storage, and Redux for state management, with a focus on code quality, user experience, and best practices.
