**Certainly! Here's a code challenge assessment for a React Native mobile developer with experience in Redux, Firebase integration, and user authentication. This challenge will test the candidate's ability to work with these technologies and demonstrate their problem-solving skills.**

**Title:** Social Media App

**Description:** You are tasked with building a React Native mobile app that serves as a basic social media platform. Users can create accounts, log in, post updates, and interact with other users' posts.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a React Native app with the following features:

    - User registration and authentication using Firebase Authentication.
    - User profile pages that display the user's information and posts.
    - A news feed displaying posts from all users.
    - The ability to create, edit, and delete posts.
    - Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication (e.g., email/password or social login methods).

2.  Implement Redux for state management to handle user data, posts, and user authentication.
3.  Integrate Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve user posts and user profiles.
4.  Ensure proper navigation between the different screens using React Navigation.
5.  Implement error handling and user-friendly feedback for situations like authentication failures or post creation errors.
6.  Make the app responsive and visually appealing.
7.  Implement unit tests for your components, Redux actions, and reducers.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Implement real-time updates for posts and user interactions using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Implement internationalization (i18n) for the app, allowing users to switch between multiple languages (e.g., English and arabic).
- Allow users to follow other users and see a feed of posts from followed users.
- Implement user profiles with profile pictures and additional user information.
- Add liking and commenting features for posts.
- Deploy the app to a mobile app store or provide instructions on how to build and run it on a physical device.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository with your React Native project and a README file with instructions on how to run and test the application. Include any necessary environment variables or configuration settings, especially Firebase configuration details.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  Code quality and organization.
2.  Completeness of the implemented features.
3.  Proper error handling and validation.
4.  Usability and user experience of the app.
5.  Effective use of Redux and Firebase integration.
6.  Unit test coverage and quality.

This challenge assesses a candidate's ability to design and implement a React Native mobile app that integrates Firebase for user authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Redux for state management, with a focus on code quality, user experience, and best practices.
